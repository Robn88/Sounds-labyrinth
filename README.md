<h1>Sounds labyrinth</h1>

Sounds labyrinth is a dynamic game,designed for students of English as a foreign language to practice their pronunciation. The basic premise of the game is to go from the start to the finish, clicking horizontally or vertically on a table cell that has the word with the target sound, in this case, the long 'e'. The pool of words, both correct and incorrect, will be randomly drawn from a pool at the game start to ensure replayability. A score tracker will record correct and incorrect answers. It is targeted at both EFL students and EFL teachers.
